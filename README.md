# {{product_info.product}} Mongo API

This is a mongoDB Configuration API, based on the [stage0_mongodb_api](https://github.com/agile-learning-institute/stage0_mongodb_api) utility. It provides a versioned configuration as code utility for the {{product_info.product}} product.

## Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (includes Docker Compose)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) which is standard on most OS's
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) to verify expected configurations

## Contributing Guide
The configurations here are versioned, it's important that you not change any of the existing dictionaries or types. You can update a collection configuration file to define a new version of the collection, and create a new dictionaries as needed. You can add a new version to the enumerators data file, or define new custom types as needed. 

Edit the appropriate files. Then use ``make test`` and visit [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082). You can edit the files in place, and refresh the page to load new configurations. You may need to drop the database in order to re-test processing, but the service does not need to be restarted.
